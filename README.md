Most of the stuff that you need to know is already in the game, but some parts probably require prior knowledge. However, I will only give the most helpful bits of additional information. (use ctrl + f or command + f)


Languages:

  Belarusian: an East Slavic language influenced by Polish. In fact, the entirety of Eastern Europe has been influenced by Polish.
  
  Chinese: a Sino-Tibetan language that is very analytic and has no cases.
  
  Czech: a West Slavic (Czech-Slovak) language. In simplifed terms, Czechia (and by extension Czech) has been Catholic, then somewhat Protestant, then rather atheist. Popular legend has it that the use of Czech in public marionette shows saved the Czech language under Hapsburg rule.
  
  Dutch: a West Germanic language that is rather conservative. In this context, it refers to Standard Dutch (ABN).
  
  General American English (GAE): a variety of English (a West Germanic language) in America that lacks distinctive social and regional features.

  German: in this context, it refers to Standard German (SHG), a West Germanic language.
  
  Hebrew: a language that ceased to be spoken by 200 AD but remained a literary language and lingua franca. In the late 19th century, Hebrew was revived largely by Eliezer Ben Yehuda (who was born into a Yiddish-speaking family in Lithuania).
  
  Hungarian: a Uralic language spoken in the Carpathian Basin. It was oppressed by more influencial languages (such as German) but it turned to oppress other minority languages as well (such as Slovak).
  
  Italian: in this context, it refers to Standard Italian/Tuscan, an Italic language. Many Italian loanwords in Polish are related to vegetables.
  
  Kashubian: a West Slavic (Lechitic) language. It was a minority language in Poland for a long time and was, to various degrees, oppressed by its neighbors (Polish, German and Russian). In 2005, it became an official regional language in some areas of Poland. It has since then recieved support from the Polish government, which now promotes the Kashubian culture and language.
  
  Latin: an Italic language that was and still is, to this day, a literary language. It is associated with Catholicism and science. While there are some fluent speakers of Latin, there currently are no native speakers.
  
  Polish: a West Slavic (Lechitic) language. The native name is polski, but the formal form is polszczyzna. Yes, one is masculine and the other is feminine.
  
  Russian: an East Slavic language that is also the most widely-spoken Slavic language (Polish is second). It is, to an extent, a lingua franca among former Soviet states.
  
  Slovak: a West Slavic (Czech-Slovak) language that is closely related to Czech. It is commonly overlooked and/or confused with Slovenian.
  
  Tsez: a Northeast Caucasian language that has 64 cases.
  
  Ukrainian: an Eastern Slavic language that has been historically oppressed by most other influencial languages in its area, such as Russian and Polish.
  
  Yiddish: a West Germanic language that descended from Middle High German. It was mainly spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe. Over the course of its history, it has been significantly influenced by Hebrew, Aramaic (a Semitic language that used to be a lingua franca), Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and more. During the late 1800s to the early 1900s, many Ashkenazi Jews immigrated to America, mainly to large cities like New York. Currently, most Yiddish speakers live in America.

Other:

  cognate: cognates are words across multiple languages that descended from the same ancesteral word in the same proto language. In names, that could mean names across miltiple languages in which the elements involved are cognates. For example, the names Надежда/_Nadezhda_ (Russian, Bulgarian), Надія/_Nadiya_ (Ukrainian), Надзея/_Nadzeya_ (Belarusian), and _Nadzieja_ (Polish) are all cognates for they all mean "hope" in their respective languages, derived from Church Slavic нада/_nada_ "hope".
  
  "Come, let me grind, and you take a rest": rough translation of "Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj", the earliest known sentence written in Polish (the modern Polish version would be "Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj" or "Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij"). The recorder of this phrase noted that "Hoc est in polonico" ("This is in Polish").
  
  Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC): a visual novel that is known for breaking the fourth wall.
  
  get lost: a phrase in English that is calqued from Yiddish, which is possibly itself calqued from Polish.
  
  Haskalah: a Jewish intellectual movement from the 1770s to around 1881. It is also called the "Jewish Enlightenment". The relevant part to this game is that some proposed to revive Hebrew in secular life and some called to eliminate Yiddish altogether.
  
  language death/extinction: language death refers to when a language has no more native speakers, while language extintion refers to when a language has no more speakers at all and has no descendents. By this definition, all Proto Languages do not count as extinct, but many could be counted as dead.
  
  register: in sociolinguistics, a register is a variety of language used by a speaker in a particular social situation or for a particular purpose. A high register is a form of language that is more formal and elaborate, while a low register is a form of language that is more casual with more slang.
